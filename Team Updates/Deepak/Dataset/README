## How Table_First Was Created (Step-by-Step)

### 1️Loading Raw Sales Data

* The raw Excel file (`cleaned_sales_dataset.xlsx`) was loaded using Pandas.
* This dataset contained both:

  * Invoice header rows (firm-level)
  * Product detail rows

---

### 2️Creating a Safe Working Copy

* A copy of the original DataFrame was created to ensure:

  * No accidental modification of the raw data
  * All transformations remain reproducible

---

### 3️ Removing Unnecessary Columns

The following columns were dropped as they were **invoice-level or redundant** for product analysis:

* `Alt. Units`
* `Gross Total`
* `SALE @18% LOCAL`
* `CGST@9%`
* `SGST@9%`
* `Round Off`

This helped keep the dataset **lean and product-focused**.

---

### 4️Forward-Filling Invoice-Level Attributes

To resolve the hierarchical structure of the raw data, the following columns were **forward-filled**:

* `Date`
* `Voucher Type`
* `Voucher No.`
* `GSTIN/UIN`

This ensured that **every product row inherited its correct invoice context**.

---

### 5️Removing Invoice Header Rows

All rows where `FIRM_PRODUCT` was empty were removed.

After this step:

* Only actual product sale rows remained
* Each row represented a valid product transaction

---

### 6️Date Normalization

* The `Date` column was normalized to remove timestamp noise.
* The data type was retained as `datetime64[ns]` for analytical compatibility.

---

### 7️Deriving Brand (Rule-Based)

A new column `brand` was derived from `FIRM_PRODUCT` using keyword-based rules, for example:

* `HIK`, `EZVIZ`, `ECO` → **Hikvision**
* `CP-` → **CP Plus**
* `DAHUA`, `DH-` → **Dahua**
* `DAICHI` → **Daichi**
* `IRANGE` → **Irange**
* `BEETEL` → **Beetel**
* Others → **Other**

This makes brand-level analysis possible without any external master data.

---

### 8️Deriving Category (Rule-Based)

A new column `category` was derived based on product description keywords, such as:

* `VDP`, `Door Phone` → Video Door Phone
* `CAM`, `DOME`, `BULLET` → Camera
* `NVR`, `DVR` → Recorder
* `CABLE`, `WIRE`, `HDMI` → Cable / Accessories
* `POE`, `SWITCH` → Networking

This enables category-wise demand and sales analysis.

---

## Final Outcome

* A **clean, flat, product-level dataset**
* No data loss
* No duplicate rows
* Fully analysis-ready
* Suitable for:

  * Dashboards (Power BI / Tableau)
  * SQL databases
  * Further aggregation tables
  * Chatbot / analytics pipelines
